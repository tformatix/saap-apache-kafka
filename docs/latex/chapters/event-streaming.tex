\section{Event Streaming}
\label{cha:event-streaming}

Event streaming is a method for processing, transmitting and storing data in real time. Data is viewed here as continuous streams of events \cite{barga2006consistent}.

At its core, event streaming involves the continuous collection and processing of data from various sources, including databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services and software applications. This data is organized into a stream of events, which are then stored, processed and analyzed in real time or retrospectively. Event streams can also be forwarded to different target technologies as required. This approach ensures that information is constantly flowing and interpreted so that the right data is available to the right applications at the right time \cite{kafkaDoc}.

\subsection{Apache Kafka as event streaming platform}

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming system used for stream processing, real-time data pipelines, and data integration at scale. Kafka combines three key functions for event streaming \cite{kafkaDoc}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Publish (write) and subscribe (read) to event streams 
    \item Store Streams
    \item Process Streams
\end{itemize}
