\section{Use Cases}
\label{cha:use-cases}

Kafka offers a wide range of use cases, as highlighted in the official documentation \cite{kafkaDoc}. These include messaging, website activity tracking, metrics, log aggregation, stream processing, event sourcing, and commit log. 

This paper specifically explores the application of Kafka in energy data exchange. The test setup involves a common Austrian Smart Meter equipped with a Smart Meter Adapter from Ã–sterreichs Energie. This adapter efficiently transmits data via MQTT, HTTP, and Modbus. The measurement data extracted from the Smart Meter is then streamed using Kafka, as further detailed in Chapter \ref{cha:practical}.
