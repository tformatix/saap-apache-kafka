\label{cha:introduction}

In today's dynamic and data-driven world, the ability to process and analyze energy data in real time is becoming increasingly important to optimize energy consumption, improve grid stability and make informed decisions. The benefit of this paper is to explain Kafka in more detail and explain how to set it up using a practical example.

Apache Kafka is a high-performance, distributed event streaming platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation as open source. It was written in Java and Scala and is designed to process large amounts of real-time data with high throughput and low latency. Kafka's key features include fault tolerance, scalability, data integrity and its open source nature, making it a popular choice for a variety of applications, including real-time analytics, data integration and microservice architecture \cite{kafkaDoc}.
