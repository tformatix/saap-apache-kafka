Kafka is undoubtedly an excellent tool for processing event streaming. However, when it comes to energy data applications, MQTT might prove to be the more suitable choice, especially due to the described limitations of Kafka. Kafka is great for scenarios where numerous servers generate a large amount of logs or other data streams. In cases involving a large network of clients with potentially limited network resources, alternative solutions may prove more viable.
